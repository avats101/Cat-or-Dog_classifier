# cat-dog_classifier
This is my first CNN project,so bear me with a main stream project idea.\
I build a Deep learning model in which basically classify the animal in the image as a Cat or Dog.\
The dataset to train/test was obtained from kaggle.\
Some specifications used for the model:-\
Used Tensor-flow 2.2.0,keras\
25 epochs were performed and an accuracy peak of 90.9% was achieved
